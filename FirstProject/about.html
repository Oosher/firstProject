            <h4 id="item-1">Mardi Gras in New Orleans</h4>
            <p>The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana, including the city of New Orleans.
                Celebrations
                are
                concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday (the
                start
                of lent in
                the Western Christian tradition). Usually there is one major parade each day (weather permitting); many
                days
                have
                several large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take place the last five days of the Mardi
                Gras season. In
                the final week, many events occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding communities, including parades
                and
                balls (some
                of them masquerade balls).

                The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow the same parade
                schedule and route
                each year. The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the earliest, Rex, the
                Knights
                of Momus and
                the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super krewes" are well known for holding large parades and events,
                such as the
                Krewe of Endymion (which is best known for naming celebrities as grand marshals for their parades), the
                Krewe of Bacchus
                (similarly known for naming celebrities as their Kings), as well as the Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure
                Club—a
                predominantly
                African American krewe. Float riders traditionally toss throws into the crowds. The most common throws
                are
                strings of
                colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated plastic "throw cups", Moon Pies, and small inexpensive
                toys.
                Major krewes
                follow the same parade schedule and route each year.

                While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon Street, major parades originate
                in
                the Uptown and
                Mid-City districts and follow a route along St. Charles Avenue and Canal Street, on the upriver side of
                the
                French
                Quarter. Walking parades - most notably the Krewe du Vieux and Chewbacchus - also take place downtown in
                the
                Faubourg
                Marigny and French Quarter in the weekends preceding Mardi Gras day. Mardi Gras day traditionally
                concludes
                with the
                "Meeting of the Courts" between Rex and Comus</p>
            <h5 id="item-1-1">History</h5>
            <p>The first record of Mardi Gras being celebrated in Louisiana was at the mouth of the Mississippi River in
                what is now
                lower Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, on March 2, 1699. Iberville, Bienville, and their men celebrated it
                as part of an
                observance of Catholic practice. The date of the first celebration of the festivities in New Orleans is
                unknown. A 1730
                account by Marc-Antoine Caillot celebrating with music and dance, masking and costuming (including
                cross-dressing).
                Excerpt | A Company Man - The Book An account from 1743 that the custom of Carnival balls was already
                established.
                Processions and wearing of masks in the streets on Mardi Gras took place. They were sometimes prohibited
                by law, and
                were quickly renewed whenever such restrictions were lifted or enforcement waned. In 1833 Bernard Xavier
                de Marigny de
                Mandeville, a rich plantation owner of French descent, raised money to fund an official Mardi Gras
                celebration.

                James R. Creecy in his book Scenes in the South, and Other Miscellaneous Pieces describes New Orleans
                Mardi Gras in
                1835:[2]

                Shrove Tuesday is a day to be remembered by strangers in New Orleans, for that is the day for fun,
                frolic, and comic
                masquerading. All of the mischief of the city is alive and wide awake in active operation. Men and boys,
                women and
                girls, bond and free, white and black, yellow and brown, exert themselves to invent and appear in
                grotesque, quizzical,
                diabolic, horrible, strange masks, and disguises. Human bodies are seen with heads of beasts and birds,
                beasts and birds
                with human heads; demi-beasts, demi-fishes, snakes' heads and bodies with arms of apes; man-bats from
                the moon;
                mermaids; satyrs, beggars, monks, and robbers parade and march on foot, on horseback, in wagons, carts,
                coaches, cars,
                &c., in rich confusion, up and down the streets, wildly shouting, singing, laughing, drumming, fiddling,
                fifeing, and
                all throwing flour broadcast as they wend their reckless way.

                In 1856 21 businessmen gathered at a club room in the French Quarter to organize a secret society to
                observe Mardi Gras
                with a formal parade. They founded New Orleans' first and oldest krewe, the Mystick Krewe of Comus.
                According to one
                historian, "Comus was aggressively English in its celebration of what New Orleans had always considered
                a French
                festival. It is hard to think of a clearer assertion than this parade that the lead in the holiday had
                passed from
                French-speakers to Anglo-Americans. ... To a certain extent, Americans 'Americanized' New Orleans and
                its Creoles. To a
                certain extent, New Orleans 'creolized' the Americans. Thus the wonder of Anglo-Americans boasting of
                how their business
                prowess helped them construct a more elaborate version than was traditional. The lead in organized
                Carnival passed from
                Creole to American just as political and economic power did over the course of the nineteenth century.
                The spectacle of
                Creole-American Carnival, with Americans using Carnival forms to compete with Creoles in the ballrooms
                and on the
                streets, represents the creation of a New Orleans culture neither entirely Creole nor entirely
                American."[3]

                In 1875 Louisiana declared Mardi Gras a legal state holiday.[4] War, economic, political, and weather
                conditions
                sometimes led to cancellation of some or all major parades, especially during the American Civil War,
                World War I and
                World War II, but the city has always celebrated Carnival.[4]

                The 1898 Rex parade, with the theme of "Harvest Queens," was filmed by the American Mutoscope Co.[5][6]
                The rumored but
                long-lost recording was rediscovered in 2022. The two-minute film records 6 parade floats, including one
                transporting a
                live ox.

                In 1979 the New Orleans police department went on strike. The official parades were canceled or moved to
                surrounding
                communities, such as Jefferson Parish, Louisiana. Significantly fewer tourists than usual came to the
                city. Masking,
                costuming, and celebrations continued anyway, with National Guard troops maintaining order. Guardsmen
                prevented crimes
                against persons or property but made no attempt to enforce laws regulating morality or drug use; for
                these reasons, some
                in the French Quarter bohemian community recall 1979 as the city's best Mardi Gras ever.

                In 1991 the New Orleans City Council passed an ordinance that required social organizations, including
                Mardi Gras
                Krewes, to certify publicly that they did not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, gender or
                sexual orientation,
                to obtain parade permits and other public licenses.[7] Shortly after the law was passed, the city
                demanded that these
                krewes provide them with membership lists, contrary to the long-standing traditions of secrecy and the
                distinctly
                private nature of these groups. In protest—and because the city claimed the parade gave it jurisdiction
                to demand
                otherwise-private membership lists—the 19th-century krewes Comus and Momus stopped parading.[8] Proteus
                did parade in
                the 1992 Carnival season but also suspended its parade for a time, returning to the parade schedule in
                2000.

                Several organizations brought suit against the city, challenging the law as unconstitutional. Two
                federal courts later
                declared that the ordinance was an unconstitutional infringement on First Amendment rights of free
                association, and an
                unwarranted intrusion on the privacy of the groups subject to the ordinance.[9] The US Supreme Court
                refused to hear the
                city's appeal from this decision.

                Today, New Orleans krewes operate under a business structure; membership is open to anyone who pays
                dues, and any member
                can have a place on a parade float.</p>
            <h5 id="item-1-2">Traditional colors</h5>
            <p>The colors traditionally associated with Mardi Gras in New Orleans are purple, green, and gold. The
                colors were first
                specified in proclamations by the Rex organization during the lead-up to their inaugural parade in 1872,
                suggesting that
                balconies be draped in banners of these colors. It is unknown why these specific colors were chosen;
                some accounts
                suggest that they were initially selected solely on their aesthetic appeal, as opposed to any true
                symbolism.[37][38]

                Errol Laborde, author of Marched the Day God: A History of the Rex Organization, presented a theory that
                the colors were
                based on heraldry: all three colors correspond to a heraldic tincture, and Rex's goal may have been to
                create a tricolor
                to represent their "kingdom". Purple was widely associated with royalty, while white was already heavily
                used on other
                national flags, and was thus avoided. Furthermore, he noted that a flag in green, gold and purple in
                that order complies
                with the rule of tincture, which states that metals (gold or silver) can only be placed on or next to
                other colors, and
                that colors cannot be placed on or next to other colors.[37]

                Following a color-themed Rex parade in 1892 that featured purple, green, and gold-colored floats themed
                around the
                concepts, the Rex organization retroactively declared that the three colors in that order symbolized
                justice, power, and
                faith. The traditional colors are commonly addressed as purple, green, and gold, in that order—even
                though this order
                technically violates the rule of tincture</p>
            <h4 id="item-2">Epiphany</h4>
            <p>Epiphany on January 6, has been recognized as the start of the New Orleans Carnival season since at least
                1900; locally,
                it is sometimes known as Twelfth Night although this term properly refers to Epiphany Eve, January 5,
                the evening of the
                twelfth day of Christmastide.[40] The Twelfth Night Revelers, New Orleans' second-oldest Krewe, have
                staged a parade and
                masked ball on this date since 1870.[41] A number of other groups such as the Phunny Phorty Phellows, La
                Société Pas Si
                Secrète Des Champs-Élysées and the Krewe de Jeanne D'Arc have more recently begun to stage events on
                Epiphany as
                well.[42]

                Many of Carnival's oldest societies, such as the Independent Strikers' Society, hold masked balls but no
                longer parade
                in public.[citation needed]

                Mardi Gras season continues through Shrove Tuesday or Fat Tuesday.</p>
            <h4 id="item-3">Days leading up to Mardi Gras Day</h4>
            <p>The population of New Orleans more than doubles during the five days before Mardi Gras Day, in
                anticipation of the
                biggest celebration.[citation needed]

                Wednesday night begins with Druids, and is followed by the Mystic Krewe of Nyx, the newest all-female
                Krewe. Nyx is
                famous for their highly decorated purses, and has reached Super Krewe status since their founding in
                2011. Nyx has
                plummeted in membership and can no longer hold their self proclaimed status as a super krewe.

                Thursday night starts off with another all-women's parade featuring the Krewe of Muses. The parade is
                relatively new,
                but its membership has tripled since its start in 2001. It is popular for its throws (highly
                sought-after decorated
                shoes and other trinkets) and themes poking fun at politicians and celebrities.

                Friday night is the occasion of the large Krewe of Hermes and satirical Krewe D'État parades, ending
                with one of the
                fastest-growing krewes, the Krewe of Morpheus.[43] There are several smaller neighborhood parades like
                the Krewe of
                Barkus and the Krewe of OAK.

                Several daytime parades roll on Saturday (including Krewe of Tucks and Krewe of Isis) and on Sunday
                (Thoth, Okeanos, and
                Krewe of Mid-City).

                The first of the "super krewes," Endymion, parades on Saturday night, with the celebrity-led Bacchus
                parade on Sunday
                night.</p>
            <h5 id="item-3-1">Mardi Gras</h5>
            <p>The celebrations begin early on Mardi Gras, which can fall on any Tuesday between February 3 and March 9
                (depending on
                the date of Easter, and thus of Ash Wednesday).[44]

                In New Orleans, the Zulu parade rolls first, starting at 8 am on the corner of Jackson and Claiborne and
                ending at Broad
                and Orleans, Rex follows Zulu as it turns onto St. Charles following the traditional Uptown route from
                Napoleon to St.
                Charles and then to Canal St. Truck parades follow Rex and often have hundreds of floats blowing loud
                horns, with entire
                families riding and throwing much more than just the traditional beads and doubloons. Numerous smaller
                parades and
                walking clubs also parade around the city. The Jefferson City Buzzards, the Lyons Club, the Irish
                Channel Corner Club,
                Pete Fountain's Half Fast Walking Club and the KOE all start early in the day Uptown and make their way
                to the French
                Quarter with at least one jazz band. At the other end of the old city, the Society of Saint Anne
                journeys from the
                Bywater through Marigny and the French Quarter to meet Rex on Canal Street. The Pair-O-Dice Tumblers
                rambles from bar to
                bar in Marigny and the French Quarter from noon to dusk. Various groups of Mardi Gras Indians, divided
                into uptown and
                downtown tribes, parade in their finery.

            <h5 id="item-3-2">Public nudity</h5>
            <p>Wearing less clothing than considered decent in other contexts during Mardi Gras has been documented
                since 1889, when
                the Times-Democrat decried the "degree of immodesty exhibited by nearly all female masqueraders seen on
                the streets."
                Risqué costumes, including body painting, is fairly common. The practice of exposing female breasts in
                exchange for
                Mardi Gras beads, however, was mostly limited to tourists in the upper Bourbon Street area.[4][57] In
                the crowded
                streets of the French Quarter, generally avoided by locals on Mardi Gras Day, flashers on balconies
                cause crowds to form
                on the streets.

                In the last decades of the 20th century, the rise in producing commercial videotapes catering to voyeurs
                helped
                encourage a tradition of women baring their breasts in exchange for beads and trinkets. Social
                scientists studying
                "ritual disrobement" found, at Mardi Gras 1991, 1,200 instances of body-baring in exchange for beads or
                other favors</p>
